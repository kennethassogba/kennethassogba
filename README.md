### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kenneth

- Iâ€™m a Research Software Engineer at Siemens, working on FPGA-based prototyping.

- Prior to that I was a PhD student in the [Apollo3 team](https://hal-cea.archives-ouvertes.fr/cea-02509714), a nuclear reactor physics industrial solver developed by the [French Atomic Energy Commission](https://www.cea.fr/english).

- Iâ€™m interested in applied mathematics and high-performance computing.

- On a daily basis, I write C++ and Python.

- I write random [notes](https://kennethassogba.github.io/notes.html).
