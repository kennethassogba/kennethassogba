### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kenneth

- Iâ€™m a Research Software Engineer at Siemens, working on FPGA-based prototyping.

- Prior to that I was a PhD student at the [French Atomic Energy Commission](https://www.cea.fr/english), contributing to the development of a nuclear reactor physics industrial solver.

- Iâ€™m interested in applied mathematics and high-performance computing.

- On a daily basis, I write C++ and Python.

- I write random [notes](https://kennethassogba.github.io/notes.html).
